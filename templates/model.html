					In this project, our target variables are age and weight, both are continuous 
					variables, so we use regression models for the prediction. A few base models 
					have been selected and we will combine them using the ensemble technique, 
					where multiple models are trained and combined to improve the system's overall 
					performance. The idea behind ensemble learning is that combining several weak 
					learners can lead to a more accurate and robust model than a single strong learner. 
					Ensemble models can be created using various techniques, including bagging, boosting, 
					and stacking. Bagging involves training multiple models on different subsets of the 
					training data while boosting combines weak learners sequentially to form a strong 
					learner. Stacking involves training multiple models and then using their outputs as 
					input to a final model. We will use stacking techniques to assign a weight to each 
					model and generate the final prediction based on multiple models.
					
					<p> 

					We have considered the following base models, but some are eliminated due to efficiency 
					and performance reasons. Please refer to the source code for the final models used. 
					
					<p>
					<ul>
					<li> Linear Regression: A type of regression model that tries to find a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable.
					<li> Gradient Boosting Regressor: A type of ensemble learning model that combines several weak decision trees to form a strong prediction model. It works by iteratively fitting new trees to the residuals of the previous ones.
					<li> SGDRegressor: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize an objective function. SGDRegressor is a linear regression model that uses SGD as its optimizer.
					<li> LGBMRegressor: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses a histogram-based algorithm to speed up training and achieve better accuracy. LGBMRegressor is a regression model that uses LightGBM as its backend.
					<li> XGBRegressor: XGBoost is another gradient boosting framework that uses a gradient boosting algorithm to build a prediction model. XGBRegressor is a regression model that uses XGBoost as its backend.
					<li> RandomForestRegressor: Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds a collection of decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. RandomForestRegressor is a regression model that uses random forest as its backend.
					<li> KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.
					<li> SVR: Support Vector Regression is a type of regression model that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to perform regression. It tries to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the predicted values and the actual values.
					<li> Keras: Keras is a high-level deep learning framework that allows you to build and train neural networks with minimal code. It provides a simple API that can run on top of various backends, including TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK.
					</ul>

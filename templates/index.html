							Birthweight is an important factor in the health of the mother and the delivery procedure of the infant.
							<li>If parents know birthweight in advance, more likely to schedule an early induction or opt for a Caesarean delivery to avoid complications, such as shoulder dystocia, cerebral palsy, etc.
							<li>Current method utilizes ultrasound technology for weight predictions. For a 9-pound baby, an ultrasound's predictive accuracy is typically 15 to 20 percent of (+/- 1 pound).
							</p>
							<p class="mb-0">
							Goal: Develop a baby weight and timing of birth predictor model using information that is easily available from electronic health records from the parents (age, weight, height).

							<h6 class="m-0 font-weight-bold text-primary">Problem Statement</h6>
						</div>
                        <div class="card-body">
							In this project, we attempt to solve the following problem statement:
							<ul>
								<li>What is the predicted weight of a newborn baby?
								<li>What is the predicted gestation age? 
								<li>What are the characteristics of mother, father, and pregnancy useful for prediction? 
							</ul>
							<p>
							There are several benefits to using machine learning models to predict gestation age and newborn weight.
							<p>
							Firstly, accurate predictions of gestational age and newborn weight can help 
							healthcare providers better manage maternal and neonatal care, potentially 
							reducing complications during delivery and improving outcomes for both mother and
							baby. In addition, by identifying at-risk pregnancies early, healthcare providers 
							can provide timely interventions and care to reduce the risk of complications.
							<p>
							Secondly, supervised learning models can help identify risk factors that may affect 
							gestational age and newborn weight, allowing healthcare providers to better 
							tailor care to each patient's needs. This can result in improved clinical 
							decision-making, more personalized care, and better health outcomes.
							<p>
							Thirdly, accurate predictions of gestational age and newborn weight can help parents 
							and families better prepare for the birth of their child. This can include 
							preparing for potential complications, arranging appropriate medical care, and 
							ensuring necessary support is in place.

							<h6 class="m-0 font-weight-bold text-primary">Approach</h6>
						</div>
                        <div class="card-body">
							This project's data source is the 2021 CDC's Natality dataset, which 
							includes information on millions of births in the United States. It has over 
							3.6 million records and hundreds of features related to mothers, fathers, pregnancies, 
							and infants. First, the dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing or 
							irrelevant data, and then a list of features is selected for model construction. 
							Next, the dataset is split into a training set, a test set, and a validation set. The 
							training set is used to train the supervised learning model, where the algorithm
							learns to predict gestational age and newborn weight based on the input features. 
							The validation set evaluates the model's performance and tunes any hyperparameters 
							to improve performance. Finally, we apply the test dataset for final testing and 
							validation. 
							
							<p>
							<p>
							Several supervised learning algorithms can be used to predict gestational age and 
							newborn weight, such as linear regression, XGBoost, and neural networks. Once the 
							model has been trained and validated, it can be used to predict the gestational age 
							and newborn weight of newborns based on their health indicators.

						</div>
                        <div class="card-body">
							This project's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to construct a machine learning pipeline - 
							EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, Model Training, Model Testing,
							Model Tuning, and Model Deployment. 
							<p>
							<p>
							We have two types of users - regular users or 3rd party systems. Regular users are parents-to-be 
							or healthcare providers and will interact with the model through a web interface. For 3rd party 
							systems, we provide a Restful API based on JSON data format. They can send one or more input requests 
							in the JSON payload, and the models return the prediction results accordingly.
